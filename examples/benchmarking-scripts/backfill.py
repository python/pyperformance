"""
Parallel backfilling helper for pyperformance runs on isolated CPUs.

Reads `sha=branch` pairs from backfill_shas.txt, invokes run-pyperformance.sh
for each revision, and lets that wrapper pin the workload to an isolated CPU,
materialize benchmark.conf, build CPython, and upload results to
speed.python.org. Stdout/stderr for each revision are captured under
output/<branch>-<sha>.(out|err).
