# When one of these dependencies is upgraded, the pyperformance major version
# should be increased to respect semantic versionning. Comparison between
# two pyperformance results of two different major versions is not reliable.
#
# To rebuild requirements.txt:
#
#   pip-compile --upgrade -o requirements.txt requirements.in

# pyperformance dependencies
# --------------------------

pyperf

# for benchmark metadata:
packaging

# Optional dependencies
# ---------------------
#
